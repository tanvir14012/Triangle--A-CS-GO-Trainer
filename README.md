# Triangle--A-CS-GO-Trainer

A Trainer App for popular multiplayer online game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive that supports users with aim assistance, visual

in C++. This is one of my hobby project. 

- Windows API (ReadProcessMemory(), WriteProcessMemory(), createtoolhelp32snapshot() etc.)
- Windows Form (C++/CLI)
- Windows GDI (Drawing box, line, player name etc.)
